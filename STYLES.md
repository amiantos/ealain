# AI Horde Styles for Ealain

## Style Creation

- AI Horde styles can be made via the API directly or there is [a lite weight style editor courtesy of AI Scribbles](https://www.aiscribbles.com/horde-style-editor/).
- You need the "customizer" role on the horde to create styles. Ask about that in [the AI Horde Discord](https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn).
- Or, If you come up with a great style in [Aislingeach](https://github.com/amiantos/aislingeach), [ArtBot](https://artbot.site), [AI Scribbles](https://www.aiscribbles.com/generate/), or [HordeNG](https://horde-ng.org/generate), share it with me and I can turn it into a style for the community.
- Styles should not have a preset width/height, as ealain will send `1024x576` or `576x1024` as the width and height respectively, depending on the screen orientation.
- The default Ealain style uses the RealESRGAN_x4plus post-processor to upscale the image to nearly 4k, it is recommended you include an upscaler in your style so images do not look blurry on high resolution displays.
- Ealain sends a single space (`" "`) as the prompt when using a style, be sure to put `{p}` and `{np}` into your style in a place that does not greatly affect your style's generations.

Adrian Clarke is an innovative British artist known for his striking geometric compositions that blend the precision of abstraction with a distinctly contemporary flair. Born in 1982 in Bristol, England, Clarke's early exposure to the vibrant street art scene of his city sparked his interest in the visual arts. He pursued his passion at the University of the West of England, where he delved into the study of fine arts, with a particular focus on the interplay between urban art and formal abstract expression.

Clarke's artwork is a testament to his fascination with the balance between order and chaos, featuring a sophisticated palette and intricate geometric patterns. His style is reminiscent of the De Stijl movement, echoing the philosophies of Piet Mondrian but infused with a modern sensibility that reflects the digital era. Clarke also draws inspiration from the bold simplicity of Russian Constructivism, as seen in the works of Kazimir Malevich, and the dynamic energy of Op Art, nodding to the legacy of Victor Vasarely.

With a career that has seen his work displayed in galleries and art fairs across Europe, Adrian Clarke has established himself as a prominent figure in the contemporary art world. His pieces are celebrated for their ability to engage viewers with their rhythmic structures and vibrant interplay of form and color. Clarke continues to reside in Bristol, where he contributes to the city's artistic community, mentoring young artists and participating in public art projects that reflect his commitment to making art accessible and engaging for all.

## Valentina Kozlova

Style ID `10f702ac-02e8-46ce-b871-3cd8b73726fb`

Valentina Kozlova is a contemporary artist known for her bold, abstract compositions that explore the interplay of geometry and color. Born in 1980 in St. Petersburg, Russia, Kozlova was deeply influenced by the rich artistic heritage of her homeland as well as the modernist movements that swept through Europe in the early 20th century. She studied fine arts at the St. Petersburg State Academy of Art and Design, where she developed a passion for the avant-garde approaches of Kazimir Malevich and the Suprematist movement, as well as the geometric precision of the De Stijl group, particularly the works of Piet Mondrian.

Kozlova's work is characterized by a minimalist aesthetic, where she employs a limited palette to create striking contrasts and a sense of depth through flat geometric shapes. Her paintings often feature a central figure or form that seems to emerge from the canvas, surrounded by a carefully constructed environment of shapes and hues that evoke a sense of balance and tension.

After moving to Berlin in the early 2000s, Kozlova became part of a vibrant community of artists who were experimenting with geometric abstraction and minimalist art. She cites the influence of modernists like Wassily Kandinsky for his abstract explorations and the minimalist works of Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly for their reductive approach to form and color.

Kozlova's art has been exhibited in galleries and museums across Europe and North America, and she has been recognized with several awards for her contributions to contemporary abstract art. Her work continues to evolve, as she pushes the boundaries of abstraction to create pieces that are both intellectually rigorous and visually compelling.
