# Ealain for macOS

Ealain is a macOS screensaver that displays abstract art generated with Stable Diffusion using the [AI Horde](https://aihorde.net). Limitless generative art gracing your screen, forever.

## Examples

These are some examples of the kind of art you may see on your screen, but you will never see these specific images.
