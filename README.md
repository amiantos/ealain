# Ealain for macOS

Ealain is a macOS screensaver that displays abstract art generated by the [AI Horde](https://aihorde.net).

## Examples

These are some examples of the kind of art you may see on your screen.

# Download

- [Download Ealain v0.1 for macOS](https://amiantos.s3.amazonaws.com/ealain-0.1.zip)

## How it works

- In `Backend` there is a node script I run at home periodically that generates new images and stores them in S3.
- The screensaver downloads a JSON file that is a simple array of image URLs, it then shows a randomized slidehow of these images. Easy!
