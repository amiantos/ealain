# Ealain for macOS

Ealain is a macOS screensaver that displays abstract art generated with Stable Diffusion using the [AI Horde](https://aihorde.net). Limitless generative art gracing your screen, forever.

## Examples

These are some examples of the kind of art you may see on your screen, but you will never see these specific images.

## Custom Styles

Ealain uses [AI Horde Styles](https://haidra.net/styles-on-the-ai-horde/) to power its image generation, meaning you can create your own style and tell the screensaver to use it instead. To learn more, check out [STYLES.md](/STYLES.md). If you create a great style, feel free to submit it in a PR to the repo, or contact me in some way so we can collaborate.

## Local Cache

Ealain caches up to 100 images of each style used on your local filesystem. You can find these images under:
- `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ScreenSaver.Engine.legacyScreenSaver/Data/Library/Application Support/Ealain`
