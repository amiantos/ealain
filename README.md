# Ealain for macOS

Ealain is a macOS screensaver that displays abstract art generated by Stable Diffusion using the [AI Horde](https://aihorde.net). Limitless generative art gracing your screen, forever.

## Examples

These are some examples of the kind of art you may see on your screen, but you will never see these specific images.

## How it works

- In `Backend` there is a node script I run at home periodically that generates new images and stores them in S3.
- The screensaver downloads a JSON file that is a simple array of image URLs, it then shows a randomized slidehow of these images. Easy!
